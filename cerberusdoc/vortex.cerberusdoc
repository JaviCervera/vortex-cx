# Module vortex

The Vortex module adds an easy to use 3D rendering engine based on OpenGL ES 2.
It is inspired by the design of the Blitz3D engine, but it uses many object oriented patterns.

>>> Coordinate system and rotations
Vortex uses a left handed coordinate system where X points right, Y points up, and Z points away from the viewer.

Rotations use euler angles expressed in degrees.

>>> Screen coordinates
In Vortex, coordinates 0,0 represent the top left corner of the screen, while coordinates DeviceWidth(), DeviceHeight() represent the bottom right. This is a common convention in many graphics libraries (like Mojo).

>>> Texture coordinates
Texture coordinates are mapped from the top left (coordinates 0,0) to the bottom right (coordinates 1,1).

>>> Triangle order
Front facing triangles are those that are mapped to the screen in clockwise order.

>>> Surfaces, meshes, and entities
A *surface* is a list of vertices and indices that when connected define a 3 dimensional shape. A surface also has a *material*, which defines its visual properties like color, textures used and shininess.

A *mesh* is a collection of surfaces that make up a single object. Basically, a mesh has as many surfaces as materials. A mesh can also have animation information (an array of bones).

An *entity* is anything that exists in your 3D world. It has a position, rotation and scale. There are many types of entities, such as cameras, lights and models. An entity by itself does not draw anything in your world, but some special types of entities do. For example, a *model* is a type of entity that puts a mesh in the world. Since a mesh could appear at many places in your world, you can have a single mesh object that can be used by several models.

A font is used to render text in Vortex.
It is composed by a texture which contains the characters used to render texts, and a set of glyphs which contains the coordinates of each character within the texture and its offset.
You normally don't generate fonts by hand, but by using the bundled fonttool utility.

# Function Load(filename:String, cache:Bool = True)
Loads and returns the font with the specified filename, or `Null` if the font could not be loaded.

# Class Graphics

`Graphics` is the class used to draw graphics on the screen in immediate mode.
For example, if you want to draw your 2D graphics above the 3D scene, after drawing all your 3D geometry, you must call `Graphics.Setup2D` to setup the context for 2D drawing, and then perform your drawing operations.

# Function Setup2D:Void(x:Int, y:Int, width:Int, height:Int)
Setups the context for 2D drawing. The parameters define the rectangle within the screen where drawing will take place. You must call this function before doing any 2D drawing.

Returns the maximum texture size supported by the device.




# Class Light Extends Entity

Vortex supports defining lights sources that can shine on objects.
By default, the maximum number of lights that can be defined simultaneously is 4, although this value can be changed when calling `World.Init`.

When a light ray hits an object, the color of the light is combined with the color of the object, and that defines the appearance of the object.
This is called *diffuse lighting*.

Also, an object can have a shininess power, which will produce highlights when a light ray hits the objects. This gives the appearance of a shiny object, like a metal surface, and is called *specular lighting*.

Finally, independently from how many light rays are hitting an object, every object also receives some amount of residual lighting, produced by all the lights. This is called *ambient lighting*.
For example, if we are in a sunny open environment, the amount of ambient lighting is much bigger than in a narrow, dark cave, because the intensity of all the lights produce a brighter residual lighting.

Currently, all light sources are **point lights**, this is, they emit light in all directions. The `World` class controls the sun light, which is a directional light that emits in one specific direction.

# Method New(parent:Entity = Null)
Creates a new point light.

# Method Color:Int() Property
Returns the color of the light.

# Method Color:Void(color:Int) Property
Sets the color that the specified light emits. White by default.




# Class Listener

# Function Instance:Entity()
Returns the instance that is the active listener.

# Function Instance:Void(e:Entity)
Sets the instance that is the active listener. The first camera that is created automatically becomes the active listener.

# Function AvailableChannel:Int()
Returns an available channel number (one that is not currently being used) that you can use with `Entity.EmitSound`.

A material represents visual information such as textures, color, or shininess.
It is used to render objects with a specific appearance.

# Method New(colorTex:Texture = Null, shader:Shader = Null)
Creates a new material with the specified color texture and shader.

# Method New(other:Material)
Creates a new material that is a copy of another one.

# Method DiscardTextures:Void()
Frees the textures used by this material.
If the textures of the material are not shared by other material, you should call this method to free the textures memory when the material is no longer needed.
You do not need to call this method if you cahce the textures (which is the default behaviour).

# Method IsEqual:Bool(other:Material)

# Method ShininessTexture:Void(tex:Texture) Property
Sets the shininess texture of the material, which is expected to be a grayscale image. When there is a shininess texture set, the `Shininess` property of the material is multiplied with the values on this texture to provide a variable shininess across the surface of the object. When you set a shininess texture, the `Shininess` property is expected to be greater than zero.

# Method ShininessTexture:Texture() Property
Returns the shininess texture of the material, or `Null` if there is no shininess texture.

# Method LightTexture:Void(tex:Texture) Property
Sets the light texture of the material.

# Method LightTexture:Texture() Property

If the value of `RefractionCoef` is negative, the cubemap will be reflective (like a metal), while if it is positive, it will be refractive (like glass or water).

# Method CubeTexture:Texture() Property
Returns the cubemap texture of the material, or `Null` if there is no cubemap texture.

# Method Shininess:Void(shininess:Float) Property

This should be the refraction value of the source medium divided by the refraction value of the destination medium.
For example, to define the refraction of light entering water from air, it would be 1.0 / 1.33.

If this value is positive, it is used to calculate the refraction of the `CubeTexture` property.
If it is negative, then this value is ignored and the `CubeTexture` is assumed to be a reflection map.
Its default value is -1.

# Method RefractionCoef:Float() Property
Returns the refraction coefficient of the material.

# Method BlendMode:Void(mode:Int) Property
Sets the blend mode of the material. This defines how the final look of the geometry using this material blends with the background, after computing texture, color and lighting information.

# Class Shader

A shader is a program that runs on the GPU to perform the drawing of all elements on the screen. Every material has a shader assigned.
Vortex comes with default shaders for 2D & 3D drawing, but you can create your own shaders.

A shader is created from two strings: one to define vertex transformation and another to perform fragment coloring. Shaders are written using GLSL ES 1.00. Every shader that you create automaticaly includes the following before your own code:

<pre>
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump int;
precision mediump float;
#endif
#define MAX_LIGHTS <Max number of lights defined in World.Init>
#define MAX_BONES <Max number of bones defined in World.Init>
</pre>

Documentation of this class will come soon!

# Method Error:String() Property
Return the description of the errors that occured while compiling or linking the shaer, if any.

# Class Texture

A texture represents a buffer in video memory that contains pixel data.
Textures can be contained in materials and applied to objects together with other information like color and opacity, or drawn to the screen directly (for example to render 2D sprites).
